# A FAIRE : 

- Be aware that the webcasts have been recorded in 2016. There is no change in the list of tasks to be done, but of course there are some differences in the details. For instance, the Docker images that we use to implement the solution have changed a bit and you will need to do some adjustments to the scripts. This is part of the work and we ask you to DOCUMENT WHAT THE REQUIRED ADAPTATIONS ARE, IN YOUR REPORT.

- Make sure to document your choices in the report. (Learning to discuss requirements with a "customer" (even if this one pays you with a grade and not with money) is part of the process!)

- We will request demos as needed. When you do your demo, be prepared to that you can go through the procedure quickly (there are a lot of solutions to evaluate!)

- You have to write a report. Please do that directly in the repo, in one or more markdown files. Start in the README.md file at the root of your directory.

- The report must contain the procedure that you have followed to prove that your configuration is correct (what you would do if you were doing a demo).

# ATTENTION 

- Read carefully all the acceptance criteria.
